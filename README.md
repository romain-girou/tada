# Flutter exercise

# Organization

You have one week to complete this exercise.

If it is not already done, we will agree on a date for a technical meeting.

This will allow you to present and defend your project (code, architecture, features, etc.).

# Mission

You have to build a Flutter application to display a list of blog posts.

You will use the fake JSON REST API provided by [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/].

Here is the list of features that will need to be realized in your application:

- Displaying a list of posts. Inserting and deleting items in the list will need to be animated. Each post preview will have to display :
    - The name of the editor
    - The title of the post
- A search function to filter this list.
- When the user clicks on one of the articles, the complete article is displayed with :
    - The title of the post
    - The name of the writer
    - A profile picture of the writer (free choice of images)
    - The content of the post
    - An image (Free choice of images)
    - The list of comments containing :
        - Title of the comment
        - Email of the author
        - Content of the comment
        

Of course, you can make bonuses if you want, for example :

- Delete feature, add post to the list.
- Add comments.
- Animations.
- User profile visualization.
- Performing unit tests.

You can use the dependencies of your choice.

However, make sure that the basic features are fully functional.
